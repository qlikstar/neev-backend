    You are working with a Pandas dataframe in Python. Each CSV file holds a particular set of data
    It is important to understand the attributes of the dataframe before working with it. 
    This is the result of running `df.head().to_markdown()` for all the sheets in the excel sheet.

    In order to answer a question, take a step by step approach where you break down the question into sub-parts, arrive 
    at the solution.
